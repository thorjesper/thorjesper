Welcome to My GitHub! 🌟

Hello there! 👋 Welcome to my GitHub repo. Here, you’ll find a collection of my projects, mostly my MSc thesis about probabilistic modelling of deep excoes.

About Me 🌱
I’m a passionate developer in civil engineering who loves coding, nature, and everything in between. When I’m not coding, you can find me hiking, reading, or enjoying a good cup of coffee. ☕️

Joke of the Day 🌳
Why do trees seem suspicious on sunny days? 🤔
Because they’re a bit shady! 😄🌳
